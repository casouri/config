abstract = {This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multi-programming system that
can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse requirements
of program scheduling and resource allocation. The system nucleus simulates an environment
in which program execution and input/output are handled uniformly as parallel, cooperating
processes. A fundamental set of primitives allows the dynamic creation and control
of a hierarchy of processes as well as the communication among them.},
